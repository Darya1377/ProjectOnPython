# Hi There!
# You may be wondering what this giant blob of binary data here is, you might
# even be worried that we're up to something nefarious (good for you for being
# paranoid!). This is a base85 encoding of a zip file, this zip file contains
# an entire copy of pip (version 19.3.1).
#
# Pip is a thing that installs packages, pip itself is a package that someone
# might want to install, especially if they're looking to run this get-pip.py
# script. Pip has a lot of code to deal with the security of installing
# packages, various edge cases on various platforms, and other such sort of
# "tribal knowledge" that has been encoded in its code base. Because of this
# we basically include an entire copy of pip inside this blob. We do this
# because the alternatives are attempt to implement a "minipip" that probably
# doesn't do things correctly and has weird edge cases, or compress pip itself
# down into a single file.
#
# If you're wondering how this is created, it is using an invoke task located
# in tasks/generate.py called "installer". It can be invoked by using
# ``invoke generate.installer``.
